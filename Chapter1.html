It was the XML format of HTML; the XML language has been used in creating many markup languages. The RSS and MathML are a few examples of the markup languages that are written using XML language. The XHTML language became a standard markup language in 2000, and it got updated again in 2002. earlier, most of the web pages and applications used to be developed using HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0.
